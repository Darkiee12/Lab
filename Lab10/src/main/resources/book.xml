            This is the first comprehensive introduction to Support Vector Machines (SVMs), a new generation learning system based on recent advances in statistical learning theory.
            Students will find the book both stimulating and accessible, while practitioners will be guided smoothly through the material required for a good grasp of the theory and its applications.
            The concepts are introduced gradually in accessible and self-contained stages, while the presentation is rigorous and thorough.
            Pointers to relevant literature and web sites containing software make it an ideal starting point for further study.
